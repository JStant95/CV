## Jed Stanton
I am a Product Manager turned Software Engineer. My new-found passion for programming has stemmed from a desire to turn ideas into reality and to contribute to building great products. Much of my work experience has involved working within a team-based culture and I thrive collabrating with others. Coding gives me the opportunity to be constantly learning, creating and problem solving; three things I massively value in my day-to-day.

## Soft Skills

#### Communication

I have strong communications skills both within a team and when interacting with a range of different stakeholders. I evidenced this during my time at District Technologies where I acted as the interface between the customer and development teams, ensuring that all feedback was transferred into the customer roadmap and journey. I also worked closely with CTO and Tech team, playing an active role in both backlog grooming and prioritisation within an Agile environment. Additionally as a private tutor I learnt to explain complex concepts in a clear and concise manner which has helped me to explain technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders.

#### Problem Solving 

My education and training (Biochemistry BSc) involved analysing complex biological processes. I have also undertaken the Graduate Law Diploma where I further developed strong critical and analytical skills. Additionally at District Technologies I was the first line of defence for bugs, all bugs found by customers were reported to me initially. I then either tried to solve the issue myself or close the loop for the developer who would be tasked with the fix. This stood me in good stead for Makers where I have worked hard on developing my process to methodically breakdown problems, regardless of their size or difficulty.
