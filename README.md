## Jed Stanton
I am a Product Manager turned Software Engineer. My new-found passion for programming has stemmed from a desire to turn ideas into reality and to contribute to building great products. Much of my work experience has involved working within a team-based culture and I thrive collabrating with others. Coding gives me the opportunity to be constantly learning, creating and problem solving; three things I massively value in my day-to-day.

## Skills

#### Communication

I have strong communications skills both within a team and when interacting with a range of different stakeholders. I evidenced this during my time at District Technologies where I acted as the interface between the customer and development teams, ensuring that all feedback was transferred into the customer roadmap and journey. I also worked closely with CTO and Tech team, playing an active role in both backlog grooming and prioritisation within an Agile environment. Additionally as a private tutor I learnt to explain complex concepts in a clear and concise manner which has helped me to explain technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders.
